This is an open source Jump & Run project. 

# It started as a game I wanted to create on my own but since it's 
# not actively developed by myself anymore I'd like to release the source and graphics for everyone to use

# What does it need now?

- More structure, better class management and some other programming improvements
- More graphics & enemys
- Gameplay elements
- Story
- and much more

# What has it already?

- A complete Animation set of the main character with running, jumping, knife swings
- Some enemies with basic animation sets
- some tiles
- Map Generator
- simple object class
- simple enemy class

I'm inviting everyone to contribute or fork or do whatever you want. It's open source now.
